excerpt: 'Nice video showing how the US troops got rid of Malaria. In the beginning anopheles mosquitoes rocked, but later on people got to know about the transmission of malaria, and so everything necessary in order avoid mosquito bites was done. But still persons like snafu are a meal for mosquitoes.   '
