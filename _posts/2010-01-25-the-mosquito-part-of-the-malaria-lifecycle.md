excerpt: 'A Great video showing the mosquito part of malaria life cycle. When pregnant mosquito drinks blood from an infected human, she also gets infected. Malaria cells reproduce and form cysts on the outer lining of mosquito’s stomach, which infest the salivary glands. Later on the saliva enters a human body when mosquito drinks blood from it.    '
