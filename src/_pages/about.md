The Malaria Museum aims to promote an awareness of malaria in the general public. It will also act as the international repository for malaria-related artefacts of note.

Through entertaining, fun and interactive exhibits, both physical and online, the museum will educate the visitor about the history of malaria, its importance as a disease, current efforts to control it and future prospects regarding its eradication.

By also acting as an independent forum where people working on malaria can share their work, the museum will contribute to the control and eradication of the disease.
