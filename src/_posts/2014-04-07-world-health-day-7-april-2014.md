## The topic for 2014 is vector-borne diseases

<p style="text-align: left;">
  World Health Day is celebrated on 7 April every year to mark the anniversary of the founding of WHO in 1948. Each year a theme is selected that highlights a priority area of public health. The Day provides an opportunity for individuals in every community to get involved in activities that can lead to better health.<a href="{{ base }}/assets/images/uploads/2014/04/DISEASESpix_ok.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2601 alignright" alt="DISEASESpix_ok" src="{{ base }}/assets/images/uploads/2014/04/DISEASESpix_ok.jpg" width="149" height="227" /></a>

  What are vectors and vector-borne diseases?
</p>

Vectors are organisms that transmit pathogens and parasites from one infected person (or animal) to another. Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by these pathogens and parasites in human populations. They are most commonly found in tropical areas and places where access to safe drinking-water and sanitation systems is problematic.

The most deadly vector-borne disease, malaria, caused an estimated 660 000 deaths in 2010. Most of these were African children. However, the world&#8217;s fastest growing vector-borne disease is dengue, with a 30-fold increase in disease incidence over the last 50 years. Globalization of trade and travel and environmental challenges such as climate change and urbanization are having an impact on transmission of vector-borne diseases, and causing their appearance in countries where they were previously unknown.
