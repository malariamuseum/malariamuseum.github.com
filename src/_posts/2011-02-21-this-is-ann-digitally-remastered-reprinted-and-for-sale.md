We had [enough trouble]({{ base }}/blog/2010/12/06/this-is-ann-a-long-time-coming/) getting hold of a copy of this book, so we took the step to get it scanned and remastered and reprinted &#8211; and it looks beautiful.

You can buy it [through eBay](http://cgi.ebay.ie/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180629510353&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT#ht_500wt_1069) or visit the [Malaria Museum Shop](http://malariamuseum.de/shop/).

The booklet is paperback 43 pages, each one is illustrated, printed on 100g/m² paper with 200g/m² cover, staple bound like the original.

The only addition is on the back page where we have added a barcode and some details about the reprint.

No credit is given in the book to the author, Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss), though his style is easy to recognise.
