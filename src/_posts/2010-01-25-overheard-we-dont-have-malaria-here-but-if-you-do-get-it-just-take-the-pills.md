_Have yet to meet anybody who takes Malaria remotely seriously: natives, foreign workers, people who have never had it, people who have had it&#8230;they all treat it like a minor inconvenience. It is fascinating how many people have implied I&#8217;m a hypochondriac because i wanted a net..everyone says the same thing &#8220;We don&#8217;t have malaria here&#8230;but if you do get it just take the pills!&#8221;_
