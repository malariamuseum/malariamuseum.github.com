excerpt: 'An ugly disease ‘tertiary syphilis’ used to be cured with the help of another deadly, but curable disease, malaria, for some period of time. With malaria, patients were given a kind of pyrotherapy due to the high and prolonged fevers.  Julius Wagner-Jauregg was the one who suggested this treatment.  '

For a brief time malaria was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with [quinine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine "Quinine"), which was available at that time. This discovery was championed by [Julius Wagner-Jauregg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Wagner-Jauregg "Julius Wagner-Jauregg"), who won the 1927 [Nobel Prize for Medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Medicine "Nobel Prize for Medicine") for his work in this area.
