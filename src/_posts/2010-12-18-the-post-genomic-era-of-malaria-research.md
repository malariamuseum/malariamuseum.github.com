In 2002 the genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite causing the most severe type of human malaria, was completed. Thus began the single genomic era of Malaria research and a wealth of new observations of the basic biology of malaria parasites that are leading to new approaches to fighting the disease.

With thanks to Don Powell and Matt Berriman from the [Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/), we now have a 3m * 1m beautiful printout of the genome map as part of the collection and the opening exhibit to an explanation of some of the research that this information has enabled.
