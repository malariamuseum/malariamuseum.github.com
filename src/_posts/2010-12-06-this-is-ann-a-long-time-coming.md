Finally ! 2 years and a couple of favours later, the Malaria Museum is now the proud owner of Dr. Seuss&#8217; &#8220;This is Ann&#8221;.

After a tip-off from Chris in Rio de Janiero that the book existed and a photo copy of a photo copy to take home I began the hunt to get hold of a copy.

It hasn&#8217;t been easy on the Museum budget, but finally, with the further help of Lenore in the USA and Daniel in Ireland we have managed to get a great condition copy.

Thank you to those involved.
